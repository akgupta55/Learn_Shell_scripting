# You have learned about essential directory operations in Bash. 
# Now, let's run a script that combines these operations.

# This script performs a series of directory operations. 
# Run the script and observe how each command works and its output.

# Print working directory
echo "Current working directory: $(pwd)"
echo 

# Creating a new directory named projects
mkdir -p projects

# Changing to the projects directory
cd projects

# Creating a new directory named project1 inside projects
mkdir -p project1

# Changing to the project1 directory
cd project1

# Creating a new file named file1.txt inside project1
touch file1.txt

# Creating a new directory named project_draft inside projects
mkdir -p ../project_draft

# Creating a new file named draft.txt inside project_draft
touch ../project_draft/draft.txt

# Listing files and directories inside projects
