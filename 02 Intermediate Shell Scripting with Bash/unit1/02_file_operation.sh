# Let's build on what you've learned.

# Instead of creating a file called example.txt and copying it to example_copy.txt, 
# modify the current code to create a file named system_logs.txt and copy it to backup_system_logs.txt.

# system_logs.txt should contain the text "System initialized."

# Don't forget to click the ☰ icon in the top left of the code editor to see the newly created files!
