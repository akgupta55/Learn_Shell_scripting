# In this task, you need to fix the increase_file_size function in the provided starter code. 
# The function is intended to take two arguments, curr and to_add, 
# representing the current file size and the amount to increase it by, respectively. 
# It should output the sum of these two arguments. However, 
# the function contains three errors that prevent it from working correctly. 
# Your task is to identify and fix these errors so that the function outputs the correct result.



# increase_file_size() {
#   curr=$0
#   to_add=$1
#   echo $curr+$to_add
# }

# result=$(increase_file_size 1024 2048)
# echo $result #Expected Output: 3072


increase_file_size() {
  curr=$1
  to_add=$2
  echo $(($curr + $to_add))
}

result=$(increase_file_size 1024 2048)
