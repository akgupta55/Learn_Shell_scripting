# Great progress so far! Now, let's put your learning to the test. Write a shell script from scratch to print Greetings, Galaxy! to the terminal. Don't forget to add a comment explaining what the script does.

# TODO: Specify what shell script to use
# We use bash shell

# TODO: Add a comment explaining what the script does

# TODO: Print out "Greetings, Galaxy!"

# Use echo to print out "Greetings, Galaxy!"
echo "Greetings, Galaxy!"
