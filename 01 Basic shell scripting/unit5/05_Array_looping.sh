# In this task, you will practice working with arrays and loops in a shell script. 
# The starter code defines an applications and update_needed array. Your task is to:

# Add "Browser" to the applications array
# Update the update_needed array to indicate that "Browser" does not need to be updated
# Use a loop of your choice to loop through the applications array
# If an application needs to be updated, print "Updating ".
# If an application does not need to be updated, print " up to date"
# The expected output of your script is:

# Plain text
# Copy to clipboard
# Updating Photos
# Email up to date
# Updating Calendar
# Browser up to date

applications=("Photos" "Email" "Calendar")
update_needed=("Yes" "No" "Yes")

# TODO: Add "Browser" to `applications`
# TODO: Update the `update_needed` array. "Browser" does not need to be updated
applications+=("Browser")
update_needed+=("No")

# TODO: Loop through the arrays. If an update is needed print "Updating <application>". 
# If an update is not needed, print "<application> up to date"

for ((i=0; i<${#applications[@]}; i++))
do
    if [ "${update_needed[i]}" == "Yes" ]
    then
        echo "Updating ${applications[i]}"
    else
        echo "${applications[i]} up to date"
    fi
done
