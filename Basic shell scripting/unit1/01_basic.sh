# Great job on learning how to write your first shell script! Now, let's practice this by running a simple script. The following script uses the echo command to print "Hello, World!". You can click "Run" to execute the script or type the following in the terminal:

#   chmod +x ./solution.sh
#   ./solution.sh

# Simple script to print "Hello, World!"
echo "Hello, World!"
