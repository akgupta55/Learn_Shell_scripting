In this task, you will play the role of a system admin tasked with troubleshooting and updating some shell scripts. This will ensure that they correctly handle exit statuses based on different conditions.

In solution.sh, you need to:

Change the first ls command so it returns a 0 exit status
Change the second ls command so it returns a non-zero exit status
In custom_exit.sh, you need:

Adjust the script so that access is granted only to the user "Cosmo".
If anyone else tries to gain access, the script should politely deny them with an exit status of 42.
By completing these adjustments, you will ensure that the scripts robustly handle these scenarios and provide accurate status feedback.

The output after running the script should be:

Plain text
Copy to clipboard
Running a successful command (ls)...
file.txt
Exit status: 0

Running a failing command...
Exit status: 2

Running successful custom_exit.sh script...
  Welcome Cosmo
Exit status of custom_exit.sh: 0

Running failing custom_exit.sh script...
  Sorry John. Access denied
Exit status of custom_exit.sh: 42
You should also get the error:

Plain text
Copy to clipboard
ls: cannot access 'my_scripts': No such file or directory
