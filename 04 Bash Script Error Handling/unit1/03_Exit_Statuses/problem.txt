In this task you are provided with some scripts that are not running correctly.

solution.sh is meant to:

Give execution permissions for custom_exit.sh and set_e.sh
Call ./custom_exit.sh John and print the exit status
Run set_e.sh and print the exit status
custom_exit.sh is meant to:

Exit with status 42 if the user is not "Cosmo"
set_e.sh is meant to:

Stop execution as soon as an error occurs
The expected output of the script should be:

Plain text
Copy to clipboard
Calling custom_exit.sh with John
  Sorry John. Access denied
Exit status of custom_exit.sh: 42

Running set_e.sh
  Running a command that will fail...
Exit Status of set_e.sh: 2
You should also see the following error:

ls: cannot access 'nonexistent_directory': No such file or directory

Can you fix the code to get the correct output?
