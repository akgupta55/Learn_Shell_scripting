In this task, you will complete three shell scripts to demonstrate mastery over handling shell script exit statuses.

solution.sh:

Make the scripts executable.
Execute division.sh with different argument combinations to observe and display exit statuses (1, 2, and 0).
Execute find_passwords.sh and display its exit status.
division.sh:

Check if the number of arguments is not equal to 2. If the check fails, print a descriptive error message and exit with status 1.
Check if the denominator is 0. If it is, print a descriptive error message and exit with status 2.
If there are 2 arguments and the denominator is not 0, print the division result and exit with status 0.
find_passwords.sh:

Ensure the script exits immediately if an error is encountered using appropriate commands.
Change the working directory to passwords
Attempt to display the contents of admin_password.txt (this command will intentionally fail), and handle the exit status accordingly.
Complete the TODOs in the given starter code files to achieve these goals. Be sure to test your scripts to ensure they handle exit statuses as expected.
