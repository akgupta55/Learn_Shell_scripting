In this task, you will observe how different shell scripts handle errors and return exit statuses. The scripts are:

custom_exit.sh:
This script exits with a custom status code (42).
cat_file.sh:
This script attempts to display the contents of a file passed as an argument.
If the file exists, it prints the contents and exits with status 0.
If the file does not exist, it prints an error message and exits with the exit status of the cat command.
set_e.sh:
This script uses set -e to exit immediately if any command within the script exits with a non-zero status.
It tries to list a non-existent directory, which will cause the script to exit before completing all its commands.
solution.sh:
Calls the ls command on an existing and nonexisting directory
Calls ./custom_exit.sh
Calls ./cat_file.sh projects/file.txt which is an existing file
Calls ./cat_file.sh nonexistent_file which is not an existing file
Calls ./set_e.sh
Run the code to observe how different scenarios are handled and how exit statuses are captured and displayed. Don't forget to check what errors occur.
