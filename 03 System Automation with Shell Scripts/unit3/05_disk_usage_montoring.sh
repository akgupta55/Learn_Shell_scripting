# Youâ€™ve done great to get this far. Now, let's write a script from scratch to monitor and manage disk usage.

# Your task is to:

# Monitor a directory named /tmp.
# Display the disk usage of all files and directories under it using du -h and du -sh.
# Create two new directories, one named big_files with a 10MB file and another named bigger_files with a 50MB file
# Display the updated disk usage statistics.

#!/bin/bash

# TODO: Set the directory to monitor to /tmp.
# FILESYSTEM=

# TODO: Display the disk usage of all files and directories under /tmp using du -h.
# TODO: Display the disk usage of all files and directories under /tmp using du -sh.

# TODO: Create two new directories, one named big_files with a 10MB file and another named bigger_files with a 50MB file.

# TODO: Print out disk usage statistics using du -h and du -sh.

# TODO: Set the directory to monitor to /tmp.

# TODO: Display the disk usage of all files and directories under /tmp using du -sh.
