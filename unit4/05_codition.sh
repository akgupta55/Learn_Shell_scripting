# In this task, you will write a shell script that verifies certain conditions before starting a download process. In order to start the download, the "./downloads" directory must exist, the file "code.txt" must not exist, and there must be enough memory.

# You need to check the following conditions:

# dir_name is not "./downloads" or there is not enough memory
# dir_name is "./downloads" but file_name is "code.txt"
# dir_name is "./downloads", file_name` is not "code.txt", and there is enough space
# None of the above conditions are true
# Follow the TODO comments to complete the script.
