# Let's find and fix the bugs in a shell script. The script is meant to:

# Create a file called system.log
# Write "Operating System Initialized" to it
# Display the file's contents
# Copy the file to system_backup.log
# Display the copied file's contents
# However, it contains a couple of mistakes. Identify and correct these errors to make the script run properly.


# # Creating a new file
# touch system.log

# # Writing content to the file
# echo system.log < "Operating System Initialized"

# # Displaying the content of the file
# echo "Displaying contents of system.log"
# cat system.log
# echo

# # Copying the file
# cp system_backup.log system.log

# # Displaying the content of the copied file
# echo "Displaying contents of system_backup.log"
# cat system_backup.log

# Creating a new file
touch system.log

# Writing content to the file
echo "Operating System Initialized" > system.log

# Displaying the content of the file
echo "Displaying contents of system.log"
cat system.log
echo

# Copying the file
cp system.log system_backup.log

# Displaying the content of the copied file
echo "Displaying contents of system_backup.log"
cat system_backup.log
